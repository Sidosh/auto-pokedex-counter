"""run() itself needs a camera and a QApplication, so only the wiring
that's been hoisted out of it is exercised here - for the bonus highlight
that's the whole app-side contract: the checkbox drives the sprite strip,
and the state it was restored in is applied at startup rather than only on
the first toggle.

wire_found_pokemon carries the other half of it: the strip knows nothing
about sections, so app.py is where a find gets classified as a catch or an
evolution.
