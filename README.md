# Pokedex Counter

A small [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) overlay window for tracking your Pokédex progress live while streaming a Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow playthrough from a Game Boy capture feed. It watches the video feed, recognizes catch, evolution and "give a nickname?" screens, and keeps a running count of the 151 Pokémon you've found — handy as an OBS window/source capture.

## Download (no Python required)

Grab the latest `PokedexCounter.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sidosh/auto-pokedex-counter/releases) and run it. Windows only.

It looks for a device named **"OBS Virtual Camera"** and uses that automatically — so start the OBS Virtual Camera before launching the app. If it can't find one (e.g. it's not running yet, or you renamed it), it falls back to camera index 2.

### What happens on launch: calibration

Every time the app starts, it calibrates itself before the counter window opens:

1. You need to launch the OBS Virtual Camera
2. A small "Calibration" preview window pops up showing your camera feed.
3. Point the feed at the **Pokémon title screen** (the "Pokémon Blue Version" boot screen) — the app matches against that screen to figure out exactly where on your camera frame the catch/evolution/nickname regions are. This is necessary because everyone's camera framing and streaming layout is different.
4. Colored boxes on the preview show live match confidence for the three regions it's searching for. Once all three are found confidently and held steady for a moment, the preview closes automatically and the counter window opens.
5. Press `Esc` at any point to skip calibration — the app falls back to whatever positions worked last time instead.

A successful calibration is remembered for next launch (saved as a `roi_calibration.py` file next to the `.exe`), so you typically only need to re-do it if your camera framing changes. You can also re-run it at any time with the **Calibrate** button, without restarting the app.

## Using the app

Two windows open side by side: the **counter window**, which is the one to capture in OBS, and a **settings window** holding every control — so nothing but the sprite grid and the count ever ends up on stream.

### The counter window

All 151 sprites plus a running "N caught". Catching a Pokémon highlights its sprite and bumps the count.

**Clicking a sprite marks or unmarks it by hand**, for when the detector misses a catch or flags one it shouldn't. Unmarking also lets that Pokémon be detected again later.

Until at least one region has been calibrated, the count is replaced by a prompt to calibrate — detection can't run at all in that state, so showing "0 caught" would look like it was working.

### The settings window

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Sprites per row | Grid width; the counter window resizes itself to fit |
| Counter font size | Size of the "N caught" text |
| Compare to WR? | Color-codes the grid against the bundled world-record route |
| Highlight bonuses | Colors bonus catches red (see below) |
| Reset counter | Clears the run and starts fresh |
| Calibrate | Re-runs calibration mid-session |

The four settings above the buttons are remembered between launches.

### Sprite colors

With both comparison settings off, every catch is plain **black**. Turning them on adds:

- **Blue** — on the WR route for a section you've already reached, but not caught yet. In other words, the WR run would have it by now and you don't. These accumulate as the run progresses, so one missed in its own section stays flagged.
- **Black** — caught, and on the WR route.
- **Green** — caught, but not on the WR route in any section reached so far.
- **Red** — caught and listed as a bonus. This wins over black and green, so a bonus stands out whether or not it's on the route.

Resetting the counter clears the accumulated blue marks so the next run re-earns them section by section. Bonus highlighting is a fixed list, so it just stays on.

The WR route is bundled as `resources/comparison/WR.json`; if it's missing or unreadable, "Compare to WR?" simply has nothing to mark. Which Pokémon count as bonuses is the `BONUSES` list in `roi_config.py`.

### Personal best

When a run reaches all 151, resetting the counter or closing the app asks whether to save it as your personal best. Saving writes `comparison/PB.json` — next to the `.exe` when running the packaged build — recording which Pokémon were caught in which section, in the same shape as the bundled `WR.json`.

## Setup (for development)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run

```bash
python -m pokedex_counter
```

## Test

```bash
pytest
```

## Build a standalone executable

```bash
python scripts/build.py
```

This produces `dist/PokedexCounter.exe` (bundled with `resources/`) using PyInstaller. Pushing a `v*` tag also builds and attaches this exe to a GitHub Release automatically (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
